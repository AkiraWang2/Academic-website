I am a Ph.D. candidate in the developmental psychopathology and clinical science program at the University of Minnesota starting in the Fall of 2023. I will be working with Dr. Sylia Wilson and other amazing faculty at the Institute of Child Development. My research examines the biopsychosocial consequences of early life stress in children, with an emphasis on parental characteristics. I am particularly interested in using data-driven approaches and behavioral genetics to study how stress alters the normative trajectory of brain development, leveraging neuroimaging techniques to identify prodromal indicators of psychopathology.
