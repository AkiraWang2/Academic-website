I am a PhD candidate in clinical and developmental psychology at the University of Minnesota. I work with Dr. Sylia Wilson. My research examines the biopsychosocial consequences of early life stress, and the inter-generational transmission of risk and resilience to psychopathology. I am particularly interested in using data-driven approaches to study how stress alter the normative trajectory of brain development, increasing the risk of poorer mental health outcomes.
