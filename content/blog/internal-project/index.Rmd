This is a blog about how to create a plot using ggplot with an open-source dataset called 'penguins'

```{r}
# install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)

# lets look at the dataset 
head(penguins)

# create a ggplot from the penguins dataset
ggplot(penguins, aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, color = species))+
  geom_point()

```
